# Matrices Calculator

## About the project

The project will be a Matrices and Vectors calculator, designed to simplify complex matrices and vector operations for students and professionals alike. The application will provide a user-friendly interface to perform various operations including matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication of matrices, making it a very helpful tool for mathematicians, and computer scientists.


As mentioned earlier, the application will mainly be used by students and professionals having to do with the fields of mathematics and computer science. This project is of personal interest to me because I also am currently taking up a linear algebra course, which consists mostly of matrices and their properties and calculations, thus I wanted to build an application that can facilitate me and fellow students to easily carry out matrix calculations, thus saving us a lot of time and effort, so we can focus on studying the more in-depth and logical aspects of linear algebra. Therefore, I am enthusiastic about developing such a robust and user-friendly application that can enhance the learning and problem-solving experiences of students and professionals.

## User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to first choose what operation I want to carry out with the matrices.
- As a user, I want to be able to input the dimensions of the matrices and input them in a grid format.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the history of my current session in a json file by adding multiple operations to the history that were carried out during runtime.
- As a user, I want to view a filtered list of any single operation in my history.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete some operations from the history.
- As a user, I want to load the history of my previous session in a new session.
